# Secret_voter - Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description

Secret_voter is a blockchain-based decentralized voting system built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. The system implements a secure and transparent voting mechanism while maintaining voter privacy through a commitment-reveal scheme. This ensures that votes remain secret during the voting period but can be verified and counted transparently once the election concludes.

The system uses cryptographic hash commitments to protect voter privacy while ensuring the integrity of the election process. Voters commit to their vote by submitting a hash, and later reveal their actual vote along with a nonce to prove their commitment was genuine.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize democratic processes by creating a trustless, transparent, and secure voting system that eliminates traditional electoral fraud while preserving voter privacy. We aim to build a foundation for digital democracy where every citizen can participate in governance with confidence that their vote matters and their privacy is protected.

The Secret_voter system envisions a future where:
- Elections are completely transparent and auditable
- Voter privacy is mathematically guaranteed
- Electoral fraud becomes practically impossible
- Participation barriers are minimized through digital accessibility
- Trust in democratic institutions is restored through technological transparency
